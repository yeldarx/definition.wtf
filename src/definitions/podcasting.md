title: What is podcasting?
definition: Podcasting is the distribution of media files via an RSS feed with an <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element. These are usually audio or video files. In this context, an RSS feed using the <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element isn’t just a technical choice — it’s a foundation for freedom and independence.

It could have been built on any other mechanism, but right now, only RSS with <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> gives us that level of openness, portability, and control. The key is that the RSS feed contains an <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> element with a direct link to the file.

If we remove RSS — or the `<enclosure>` element — and everything falls apart. We lose the definition of everything. What is podcasting? How is podcasting different from streaming or radio? RSS with an `<enclosure>` element is the cornerstone of podcasting. It’s not just a technical detail — it’s the very thing that makes a podcasting *a podcasting*.

Without this distinction, it becomes impossible to tell podcasting apart from YouTube — or even Dropbox. Sure, those platforms might be more convenient, more intuitive, more centralized, with “smart” recommendations and polished interfaces. But they are also controlled: bound by laws, rules, algorithms, and corporate interests. You can call that many things — but if it doesn’t involve RSS with an `<enclosure>` element, it’s not podcasting.

When does a piece of audio become *radio*? When it’s broadcast over the airwaves. Before that, it’s just audio. Why does the same exact text get different names depending on how it’s sent? If sent over SMTP — it’s email. If sent over the SS7 signalling protocol — it’s an SMS. Even though the content is exactly the same.

Same with the podcasting. It becomes the podcasting only because it distributing files via RSS with an `<enclosure>` element. Not content production, feeling, or opinion — just the delivery method.

Oh, right — podcasting is not about content creation. Recording audio or video is production, with its own stages: pre-production, production, post-production. Podcasting only begins at the moment of publishing via RSS.

Now think: what is a podcast?

See — the answer is obvious. No? Let’s try to figure it out together on [this page](/podcast/).
